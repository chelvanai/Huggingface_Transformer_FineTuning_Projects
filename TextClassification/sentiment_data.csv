"""Tell me, glass, tell me true!",N
"Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest, tell me, who?""",N
And the glass answered:,N
"""Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween; But lovelier far is the new-made queen.""",N
"When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.",A
"And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.",H
"Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership and set up house together.",N
"For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores.",H
"The bird""s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking.",N
When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new.,F
"And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements.",H
"But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it.",Su
"For, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table.",N
"The sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served.",H
"Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life.",N
"Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work.",A
"Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.",A
"They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.",Sa
And now what happened?,F
"The sausage started in search of wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day.",N
"But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him.",F
"He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him.",F
"The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.",A
"He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard.",Sa
"They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.",Sa
"So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.",F
"Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook.",Sa
"In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found.",F
"Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze.",F
"The bird hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.",F
"There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son; and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the King""s daughter for his wife.",N
"It happened that soon afterwards the King came into the village, and no one knew that he was the King, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, ""A child has just been born with a caul on; whatever any one so born undertakes turns out well.",N
"It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the King""s daughter for his wife.""",N
"The King, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, ""You poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.""",N
"At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought, ""It is a luck-child, and everything must turn out well for it,"" they at last consented, and gave him the child.",N
"The King put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought, ""I have freed my daughter from her unlooked-for suitor.""",H
"The box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it.",N
"And it floated to within two miles of the King""s chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a stand-still at the mill-dam.",N
"A miller""s boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively.",N
"He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, ""God has given him to us.""",H
"She started when she saw the boy, and said, ""Whence do you come, and whither are you going?""",N
"""I come from the mill,"" he answered, ""and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.""",N
"""You poor boy,"" said the woman, ""you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.""",F
"""Let them come,"" said the boy, ""I am not afraid; but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther:"" and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.",N
"Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there?",A
"""Ah,"" said the old woman, ""it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in; he has to take a letter to the Queen.""",N
"The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.",N
"Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King""s daughter.",Sa
"Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.",N
"And the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King""s daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment.",H
"After some time the King returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter.",N
"""How has that come to pass?"" said he; ""I gave quite another order in my letter.""",Su
"So the Queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it.",N
The King read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.,N
"He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it.",N
"""I know nothing about it,"" answered he; ""it must have been changed in the night, when I slept in the forest.""",N
"The King said in a passion, ""You shall not have everything quite so much your own way; whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil; bring me what I want, and you shall keep my daughter.""",A
"""That is a good deal to ask for,"" said she; ""if the devil comes home and finds you, it will cost you your life; but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot help you.""",Su
"She changed him into an ant and said, ""Creep into the folds of my dress, you will be safe there.""",N
"""Yes,"" answered he, ""so far, so good; but there are three things besides that I want to know: why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water; why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves; and why a ferry-man must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free?""",N
"""Those are difficult questions,"" answered she, ""but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs.""",N
"As the evening came on, the devil returned home.",N
No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.,Su
"""I smell man""s flesh,"" said he; ""all is not right here.""",A
"Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything.",N
His grandmother scolded him.,A
"""It has just been swept,"" said she, ""and everything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again; you have always got man""s flesh in your nose.",A
"Sit down and eat your supper.""",N
"When he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother""s lap, and before long he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily.",N
"Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down near her.",N
"""Oh!"" cried the devil, ""what are you doing?""",Su
"""I have had a bad dream,"" answered the grandmother, ""so I seized hold of your hair.""",N
"""What did you dream then?"" said the devil.",N
"""I dreamed that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water would flow out of it; what is the cause of it?""",N
"""Oh, ho! if they did but know it,"" answered the devil; ""there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well; if they killed it, the wine would flow again.""",H
He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook.,N
Then she pulled the second hair out.,N
"""Ha! what are you doing?"" cried the devil angrily.",A
"""Do not take it ill,"" said she, ""I did it in a dream.""",N
"This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.",F
"At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ""Throw the rascal up here!""",F
"After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.",H
"There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers.",N
"When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too.",Sa
"So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor.",N
"""Oh, yes,"" said the doctor, ""that is soon managed.""",Su
"""What must I do?"" asked the peasant.",N
"""In the first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: ""I am Doctor Knowall,"" and have that nailed up above your house-door.""",N
The peasant did everything that he had been told to do.,N
"When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen.",Sa
At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.,Sa
"These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs.",N
"It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.",N
"One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.",Sa
"Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: ""What ails you, dear wife?""",F
"""Ah,"" she replied, ""if I can""t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.""",Sa
"The man, who loved her, thought: ""Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.""",F
"At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.",N
"She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.",H
"It tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.",Sa
"If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.",A
"In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.",F
"""How can you dare,"" said she with angry look, ""descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief?",A
"You shall suffer for it!""",A
"""Ah,"" answered he, ""let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.",F
"My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.""",F
"The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.",F
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun.,N
"When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.",Su
"When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried:",N
